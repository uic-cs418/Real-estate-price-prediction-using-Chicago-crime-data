There are only a handful of communities that have almost zero or positive correlation. Communities that has positive correlation mostly has a high price of real estate. We guess that police is more present in these areas, as well as residents there tend to report more crimes. (We didn't consider the seriousness of crime types)\n",

However, we can't claim the reason is due to fall is crime alone because price rise can be attributed to multiple factors: inflation, the economy, the surrounding environment, .etc\n",

    "We developed an interactive data exploration app that allowed users to explore real estate and crime data by community. On the top left, we have a heatmap of price data, where the lighter the color, the more expensive price per square foot in that community. Oppositely, the darker the color, the cheaper the price. Users can use the year slider to see how the price heatmap changes over time. Users can also use the price range slider to filter out communities in a certain price range. The top right scatter plot depicts price and total number of crimes in a community, each dot represents a community. In addition, user can click on 1 community in the heatmap, and it will be highlighted in the scatter plot, as well as its crime trend and real estate trend will be shown on the 2 bottom time series graphs\n",
